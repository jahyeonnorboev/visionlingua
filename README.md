VisionLingua --- AI-Powered Visual Language Learning Assistant

**VisionLingua** is an AI-assisted language learning application
designed to help users understand unfamiliar words and text from images.
Users can upload an image or enter text directly, extract text with OCR,
translate the extracted content, listen to the original and translated
text, and use vocabulary-learning tools.

> Project documentation is based on the available research notes and
> application screenshots. Features described as planned or under
> improvement should not be interpreted as fully completed.

 Overview

The project began as an **AI-based personalized language-learning
assistant**. During the planning stage, the team discussed pronunciation
assessment, grammar correction, personalized vocabulary lists, spaced
repetition, and conversational practice.

As development progressed, the prototype direction focused on a
practical visual translation workflow: extracting text from images and
helping learners understand and review it. The application interface is
titled **VisionLingua** and describes itself in Korean as a camera-based
AI translator.

  Main Application Workflow

1.  **Upload an image** --- Select an image file (JPG, JPEG, or PNG)
    containing text.
2.  **Extract text with OCR** --- Choose the OCR language and run text
    extraction.
3.  **Translate** --- View the translated result in the results panel.
4.  **Listen to the text** --- Use text-to-speech controls to listen to
    the original text and its translation.
5.  **Study vocabulary** --- The interface includes vocabulary, quiz,
    learning-statistics, and settings sections.

Users can also enter or paste text directly instead of uploading an
image.

   Features Visible in the Prototype

-   Image upload for JPG, JPEG, and PNG files
-   OCR language selection
-   Text extraction from an uploaded image
-   Translation result display
-   Direct text input as an alternative to image upload
-   Text-to-speech controls for the original and translated text
-   Navigation sections for vocabulary, quizzes, learning statistics,
    and settings

The screenshots confirm the presence of these interface elements. The
exact persistence, analytics, and quiz behavior should be documented
further only after checking the corresponding implementation.



Team members proposed several project ideas, including a
financial-information application, a medical communication application,
and an AI-based language-learning assistant. The team selected the
language-learning idea proposed by **Shohjakhon Norboev**.

  Initial planning and prototype

The initial concept included:

-   Pronunciation analysis and feedback
-   Grammar correction
-   A personal vocabulary list and spaced repetition
-   Conversational practice with an AI chatbot

The initial architecture was discussed around speech models such as
Whisper or wav2vec2, language models such as BERT or GPT, a
FastAPI/Django backend, a React/Next.js frontend, and
PostgreSQL/MongoDB.

A UI prototype was also started using React and Tailwind CSS, according
to the research notes.

Core learning functions ->
The research notes describe implementation work on three learning
functions:

-   **Pronunciation assessment:** Whisper-based speech-to-text, followed
    by a text-similarity comparison against a target sentence. The notes
    identify the `/speech/analyze` endpoint.
-   **Grammar correction:** GPT-based sentence correction and
    explanations through `/grammar/correct`.
-   **Vocabulary and review scheduling:** A basic vocabulary-management
    test using temporary data and review intervals of 1, 3, and 7 days.

The notes describe a FastAPI backend using Python 3.10, Whisper and GPT
APIs, and SQLite for testing. PostgreSQL integration and the
React/Next.js frontend were listed as future work at that point.

Demo review and improvement proposals

During the demo review, the team identified issues with OCR recognition,
translation consistency, dictionary API response times, text-to-speech
naturalness, and UI usability.

Proposed improvements included:

-   Image preprocessing with OpenCV, including noise reduction, contrast
    enhancement, and binarization
-   Testing OCR pattern customization for mixed-language text
-   Evaluating Hugging Face MarianMT for context-aware translation
-   Comparing dictionary services such as Oxford, Cambridge, and Papago
-   Evaluating more natural TTS options
-   Improving vocabulary management and spaced-repetition scheduling
-   Considering web and mobile deployment options

These items are recorded as proposals or future improvements, not
confirmed completed features.

## Current Limitations and Future Work

The November 3 research notes identify the following areas for
improvement:

-   Improve OCR accuracy for low-light images, distorted characters, and
    small text.
-   Improve translation consistency and handling of proper nouns.
-   Reduce dictionary API latency and improve reliability.
-   Make TTS voices sound more natural to support pronunciation and
    intonation learning.
-   Improve the UI for practical everyday use.
-   Expand vocabulary management with deletion and review scheduling.
-   Evaluate spaced repetition for more effective review.
-   Investigate web and mobile deployment.

The notes mention Streamlit Cloud, Vercel, Flutter Web, and React Native
as possible deployment or expansion options. They are proposals, not
confirmed deployment targets.

Running the ...

The research notes do not provide a verified final installation
procedure or complete dependency list. For that reason, setup commands
are intentionally not included here. Add the following after checking
the actual repository:

1.  Required runtime and version
2.  Dependency installation command
3.  API keys and environment variables
4.  Local development command
5.  OCR language/data setup, if required

 Project Status

This README describes the project using the research notes dated
September 17, September 29, October 29, and November 3, 2025, together
with the supplied application screenshots. It distinguishes documented
prototype work, visible UI elements, and proposed improvements. The
final implementation details should be verified against the source code
before making stronger technical claims.
